We are using kiddLib.aar for showing subsciption details as per the requirements.
We have our MainActivity where first we configure our app for authorisation by providing the api key.
Once it is done we get the userid from EditText and fetch Subscription details once successfully details are capture we displayed three items on UserProfile screen and those are as follows:

1.Membership Status: Active/Expired/None

2.Member Since: Date in “February 25, 2021” format (or N/A) [Use the purchase date from the API response to derive this]

3.Valid Till: Date in “March 25, 2021” format (or N/A)
